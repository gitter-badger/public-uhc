# Public UHC

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/public-uhc/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/public-uhc/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/public-uhc/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

An open-source simple UHC system for your server.

# NOTICE
This project is newly being developed! If you plan to use this on your server, make sure to get a stable release.
Since this project is new, there are not going to be many stable releases. Sorry for the inconveniences!

## Features

  - NONE YET, THIS PROJECT IS JUST GETTING STARTED!

## To Do List

  - UHC Itself
  - Simple API for adding more uhc modes/modules
  - Module System
  - GUI Based UHC system
  - Custom world generation based on mode. (Can be added as a module)
  - Scoreboards/Titles/Actionbars/BossBar - We'll see where it goes.
  - API (If requested enough, will work on after major pieces are done)

### A note on the scoreboards..
We plan to be using an epic library known as [**SpigotLib**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spigotlib.5925/).
This library has tons of features that we will not be using, but for any developers looking for a simple api, heres a heads up! ;)

### What is a module?
A module is essentially a plugin but for UHC. They can add custom world generation or add new twists in uhc.
All modules can be simply enabled and disabled in-game through a gui.
Most basic modules such as [Episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22QkCePpiSQ), [Borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22QkCePpiSQ), (Which can shrink/grow based on times), Golden Heads, and much more.

### Modules Using Our API

There are currently none, due to the early stage of our plugin.
If you plan to use our api, or already have *some how*, DM ItsErik#4490 on the [Discord][discord]. Once joined, type `-role puhc` in the `#role-request` channel.

| Module Name | Description | Location |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| No Modules :( | No Description :( | No Place :( |
